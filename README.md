Project: Defeat the Evil Wizard 
In this mini-project, I created a hero character and battled the powerful Evil Wizard. I used Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts to extend starter code, customize the characters, and add new functionality. Through a simple menu system, you'll control the character by choosing actions like attacking, using special abilities, healing, and viewing stats. The task was to modify the starter code and defeat the Evil Wizard by implementing your own logic and design
